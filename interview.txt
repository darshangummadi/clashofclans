Dev tools/ Debugging:
1. Name two ways to pause a script's execution in the browser.
- possible answers: set a breakpoint, use the debugger; statement, hit the pause button in the dev tools, click "break on exceptions"
 
2. Let's say I have some client side code that needs to make a call to the server to get some data and it isn't working the way I expect. What can I do to determine if the issue is on the client or server side when I don’t have access to the server or the code?
- possible answers: check the network tab to see if the request is sent and check the response for that request. use a breakpoint to see if the callback executes. check the server for any errors
 
4. Debug this code snippet:
 


function broken(str){
var b = 0;
if(a = 5)
  b = a
else
  b = 5;
  return b
for(var i = 0; i <= str.length; i++){
    str[i] = (str[i] === z) ? y : n;
}
str;
}

 
5. Talk me through what this script does:


function myFunction() {
    var x, text;
    x = document.getElementById("number").value;
    if (isNaN(x) || x < 1 || x > 10) {
        text = "Input not valid";
    } else {
        text = "Input OK";
    }
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text;
}
 
Angularjs:
What is $scope?
 
$scope is how a controller delivers the model to the view. It also will contain the set of data and functions available to the controller.
Let’s say you have an array var fruits = [“apple”,”banana”,”orange”];
How can you create some HTML element that repeats for each item in the array with only one line of HTML using angular?
 
// answer: <div ng-repeat=”fruit in fruits>{{fruit}}</div>
Really only care that they come up with ng-repeat. The rest isn’t really important.
What is one-time data-binding and what is the syntax for using it?
One time data binding allows the template to reference data from the $scope when it loads but that element will not be updated if the controller data changes.
{{::my_var}}
