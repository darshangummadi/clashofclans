6. Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practices

Story:
In my role at First Citizens Bank, I followed TDD practices to develop reliable and scalable applications using Python. Each feature was accompanied by corresponding unit tests, ensuring the code was rigorously tested before deployment. This approach, combined with continuous integration (CI) tools such as Jenkins, significantly reduced bugs and improved code quality.

Technical Terms & Keywords:

	•	TDD, Unit Testing, CI/CD, Jenkins, Git, Automated Testing

Applications:

	•	Jenkins, Git, Docker, Python, Unit Testing

7. Deploy and Manage Data and Software Solutions on Cloud Platforms (GCP, Azure, AWS)

Story:
In my experience with GCP and AWS, I was responsible for deploying various data pipelines and applications. For example, at First Citizens Bank, I deployed a microservices-based architecture on GCP, leveraging GKE for scaling. I also worked with AWS Lambda and EC2 instances to optimize the deployment of ETL jobs and Python-based applications. This reduced infrastructure costs by 35%.

Technical Terms & Keywords:

	•	GCP, AWS, Azure, GKE, AWS Lambda, EC2, Cloud Deployment, Cost Optimization

Applications:

	•	AWS (EC2, Lambda), GCP (GKE, Cloud Functions), Jenkins, Docker

8. Optimize Cloud Resources for Performance and Cost-efficiency

Story:
While at TPG Telecom, I optimized cloud resources by migrating applications to AWS, reducing infrastructure usage by 35%. I also implemented horizontal scaling using AWS Redshift and Apache Spark to handle millions of user data points efficiently. This optimization improved both performance and cost-efficiency for the system.

Technical Terms & Keywords:

	•	Cloud Optimization, AWS, EC2, S3, Lambda, Spark, Cost-Efficiency, Performance Tuning

Applications:

	•	AWS (EC2, Lambda, Redshift), Spark, Jenkins

9. Utilize DevOps Tools like Jenkins, Git, and Docker for CI/CD

Story:
At TPG Telecom, I played a crucial role in automating the deployment pipeline using Jenkins and Docker, which improved the CI/CD process by 76%. I integrated multiple microservices with Docker containers, allowing for faster deployment and better resource utilization. Version control with Git ensured smooth collaboration across teams.
