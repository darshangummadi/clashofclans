28. 1. Name two ways to pause a script's execution in the browser.
- possible answers: set a breakpoint, use the debugger; statement, hit the pause button in the dev tools, click "break on exceptions"
 
29. Let's say I have some client side code that needs to make a call to the server to get some data and it isn't working the way I expect. What can I do to determine if the issue is on the client or server side when I don’t have access to the server or the code?
- possible answers: check the network tab to see if the request is sent and check the response for that request. use a breakpoint to see if the callback executes. check the server for any errors

30. Debug this code snippet:
 
function broken(str){
var b = 0;
if(a = 5)
  b = a
else
  b = 5;
  return b
for(var i = 0; i <= str.length; i++){
    str[i] = (str[i] === z) ? y : n;
}
str;
}
